  <h1>Arcanum Fortuna</h1>

  <p>
    This game was developed as a student project in 10 weeks at the <a href="https://www.school4games.net">School For Games</a> in Berlin! <br />
    <b>IMPORTANT!</b>I joined developement for the <b><i>final two weeks</i></b>, because the team lost their UI programmer.<br />
    UI programming was my main focus here and I had to read into the code base, as well as Godot 4.2.1.

  <h2>Engines / Languages</h2>
  Godot 4.2.1, GDScript

  <h2>Roles</h2>
  - UI programmer -<br />
  - Programming assistance -<br />
  
  <hr />
  <h2>Responsiblities</h2>
  - UI programming -<br /><br />
    After getting introduced into the code by my lead programmer,<br />
    we planned ahead, using a class structure diagramm. (UML)<br />
    I wrote one before, but this was my first "serious" use, which helped me <b>A LOT</b>, when coding.<br />
    Another responsibility: A lot of code had to be replaced, as a lot was still prototype code, not modular enough for further use.<br /><br />
  - Assisting the team as a programmer -<br /><br />
  Helping my team with implementation of assets and ideas was a daily given.<br />
  Since the team was amazing, there was not much work here.<br />
  I also took over some bug search / fixing, that my lead engineer simply had no time to attend to.<br />
  This turned out to work out really well, we made a great team!<br /><br />

  <h2>Example scripts</h2>
  Here are some scripts, I'd like to show:<br /><br />
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/LumiToad/ArcanumFortuna/tree/main/systems/tutorial">The entire tutorial</a></li>
    This was a lot of work. Besides the old Tutorial, everything here is my work.<br />
    It builds upon the card battle phase system, which was already part of the game.<br />
  </ul>
